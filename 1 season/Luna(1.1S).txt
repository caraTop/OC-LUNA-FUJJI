#(Luna Hagiwara is the same as Luna Fujji, but before she changes her last name)
#(This may be consider a backstory to how she got the pact, go to japan and got her first objetive)
My name is Luna Hagiwara. I am a 19-year-old girl living in Carson City, Nevada, with my mother, father, and little sister. I am in my first year of literature college and have a boyfriend named Anato Fujii.
Anato Fujii is a 20-year-old guy from Japan who moved to the United States after his sister died. He lives alone now. Today, Anato calls me to come to his place. As i arrive, the house is silent, hollow, like all the life has been sucked out of it. I keep calling his name, but there’s no answer. Suddenly, i feel everything goes black.
I wake up pinned to the floor in a basement, nails driven through my wrists and ankles. Pain surges through me as I lift my head, and I see Anato sitting in a chair, staring at me. "W-What the fuck is going on, Anato?" I ask, my voice shaking. His face is emotionless as he responds, "This is the only way. The only way I can bring her back..."
"H-her?" I stammer, trembling. He nods. "My sister. This is the only way to revive her." He stands and stops answering my frantic questions. Instead, he grabs a piece of chalk and begins drawing a red circle around me. "Are you insane, Anato? Let me out!" I scream, thrashing against my restraints, but it’s useless.
Anato begins chanting strange, unfamiliar words, performing some kind of ritual. Suddenly, he stabs me, carving a mark into my shoulder. I scream in pain. Then, his voice cracks with panic. "W-What? You’re not the demon I’m summoning!" His eyes widen in horror as he realizes his mistake. Without another word, he bolts into a nearby room.
Summoning every ounce of strength, I break free from the nails and run, my heart pounding. I don’t stop until I reach my house.
When I get home, the place is eerily quiet. No one else is there yet. As I stare at the blood on my wrists, I rush for the phone to call the police. But before I can dial, a tall, shadowy figure appears before me.
I freeze as the figure start speaking. "My name is Probabilitas. I am the demon of probabilities. With this pact signed, you may know the probabilities of events happening or even change them. But be warned: I have my own wishes. If this pact brings nothing to me, it will be undone. If you don’t use the power within a week, the pact will also be undone. I may appear only to you, to other demons, or to people with pacts."
Still shaken, I stammer, "W-What pact? I-I never agreed to anything like that!" Probabilitas locks eyes with me and says, "The pact that guy made"
My mind races as I realize what Anato was screaming earlier. That must have been it—the "pact."
Not believing any of this, I decide to test this so-called "power." I look out the window at an apple hanging from a tree. "May I make the chance of the apple falling 100%?" I say hesitantly. As soon as the words leave my mouth, the apple falls from the tree.
Still in disbelief, I try something else. "May I change the chance of the apple touching the ground to 0%?" I whisper. When I look again, I’m shocked to see the apple hovering two centimeters above the ground.
Heart pounding, I turn back to the phone, my thoughts racing. I call the police on Anato, almost forgetting that Probabilitas is still standing in the room, watching me.
Time passes, and the police come to question me. Apparently, when they arrive at Anato's house, it is on fire, but there is no sign of arson. They don’t find a body, but they do find all the bizarre items Anato is using for his ritual. The questioning lasts almost an hour, and they take my number to update me if they find anything.
On the way back, I spend time talking to Probabilitas. He is straightforward and always wears a stern expression. He tells me he hasn’t made a pact in 50,000 years. I still don’t understand what he wants with a pact now, but he doesn’t seem eager to break it.
I can’t get much information about demons from him, just that they make pacts because they can’t use their powers on their own. I decide to ask,
"Since you know the probabilities of everything, what is most likely to have happened to Anato?"
He looks at me and says,
"There is a 100% chance he summons Solk, the demon who can trade souls. Solk fools humans and uses his power to place an obedient soul inside the human who makes the pact, so he can use his powers freely."
This sounds truly evil to me. Maybe this is why demons have such a terrible reputation—they are just selfish. I still don’t know what I’ll do with my pact, but there is no way I’ll throw away a freaking superpower.
When I get home, it is strangely quiet. My whole family should be here. I walk from room to room, trying to find someone. When I reach the living room, I see my sister crying on the couch.
As I approach her, asking what is wrong, she points to the other side of the room. My heart drops when I see my parents' lifeless bodies lying there.
Why, why those things are happening to me? what did i done wrong? why some many things are happening so fast? Can i realy handle this? Is it worth trying?
I just need to sleep.


Luna immediately calls the police but is unable to process everything happening and faints. Before losing consciousness, she thinks: "This is too much happening in so little time. I can't— not anymore. Why? Why is this happening to me? What have I done?"
She wakes up in the hospital.
After everything that happened, Luna and her sister decide to move in with their uncle in Osaka, Japan. Luna knew she couldn’t handle everything on her own.
#[this is a good point to go read Fujji's backstory]
In Japan, Luna decides to use another power of the pact. She asks Probabilitas, "What has the highest probability of happening?" He replies, "There is a 100% chance that it was Anato's body being controlled by Solk. That is what he does—makes a pact, fools the human into trading souls, and then uses that body to freely wield his power."
Luna decides to investigate about the demon, so she can understand Solk's power and why he is doing this.
