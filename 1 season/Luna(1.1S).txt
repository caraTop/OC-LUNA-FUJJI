#(Luna Hagiwara is the same as Luna Fujji, but before she changes her last name)
#(This may be consider a backstory to how she got the pact, go to japan and got her first objetive)
My name is Luna Hagiwara. I am a 19-year-old girl living in Carson City, Nevada, with my mother, father, and little sister. I am in my first year of literature college and have a boyfriend named Anato Fujii.
Anato Fujii is a 20-year-old guy from Japan who moved to the United States after his sister died. He lives alone now. Today, Anato calls me to come to his place. When I arrive, the house is silent, hollow, like all the life has been sucked out of it. I call his name, but there’s no answer. Suddenly, everything goes black.
I wake up pinned to the floor in a basement, nails driven through my wrists and ankles. Pain surges through me as I lift my head, and I see Anato sitting in a chair, staring at me. "W-What the fuck is going on, Anato?" I ask, my voice shaking. His face is emotionless as he responds, "This is the only way. The only way I can bring her back..."
"H-her?" I stammer, trembling. He nods. "My sister. This is the only way to revive her." He stands and stops answering my frantic questions. Instead, he grabs a piece of chalk and begins drawing a red circle around me. "Are you insane, Anato? Let me out!" I scream, thrashing against my restraints, but it’s useless.
Anato begins chanting strange, unfamiliar words, performing some kind of ritual. Suddenly, he stabs me, carving a mark into my shoulder. I scream in pain. Then, his voice cracks with panic. "W-What? You’re not the demon I’m summoning!" His eyes widen in horror as he realizes his mistake. Without another word, he bolts into a nearby room.
Summoning every ounce of strength, I break free from the nails and run, my heart pounding. I don’t stop until I reach my house.
When I get home, the place is eerily quiet. No one else is there yet. As I stare at the blood on my wrists, I rush for the phone to call the police. But before I can dial, a tall, shadowy figure appears before me.
I freeze as the figure start speaking. "My name is Probabilitas. I am the demon of probabilities. With this pact signed, you may know the probabilities of events happening or even change them. But be warned: I have my own wishes. If this pact brings nothing to me, it will be undone. If you don’t use the power within a week, the pact will also be undone. I may appear only to you, to other demons, or to people with pacts."
Still shaken, I stammer, "W-What pact? I-I never agreed to anything like that!" Probabilitas locks eyes with me and says, "The pact that guy made"
My mind races as I realize what Anato was screaming earlier. That must have been it—the "pact."
Not believing any of this, I decide to test this so-called "power." I look out the window at an apple hanging from a tree. "May I make the chance of the apple falling 100%?" I say hesitantly. As soon as the words leave my mouth, the apple falls from the tree.
Still in disbelief, I try something else. "May I change the chance of the apple touching the ground to 0%?" I whisper. When I look again, I’m shocked to see the apple hovering two centimeters above the ground.
Heart pounding, I turn back to the phone, my thoughts racing. I call the police on Anato, almost forgetting that Probabilitas is still standing in the room, watching me.
Time has passed, the police come to ask me question. Aparentily, when they got there, Anato's house was on fire, but there was nothing that made apear arson. They didn't find any body, but the found all the crazy stuff Anato was using on his ritual. they spend almos a hour making me question, 
Realizing the power she now possesses, Luna decides to confront Anato at his house.
When she reaches Anato's house, she sees the door open, so she rushes to the basement, where she finds Anato dead, his body consumed by flames. At the center of the room, a demonic figure surrounded by fire looks at her. Terrified, Luna runs out of the house as the flames seem to follow her. She collapses to the ground, unable to stop thinking about Anato's burning face. The entire house glows with fire, lighting up her face as she sits in shock.
She asks Probabilitas if he knows who the demon inside was. He replies, "That is Solk, the oldest demon in this world. He has the power to exchange souls between humans."
Luna, overwhelmed, says, "This is too much to think about. I’ll deal with it tomorrow."
As she heads back home, she notices it is already 11 PM. When she gets home, she is horrified to find her parents dead and her little sister crying in the corner of the couch. Luna immediately calls the police but is unable to process everything happening and faints. Before losing consciousness, she thinks: "This is too much happening in so little time. I can't— not anymore. Why? Why is this happening to me? What have I done?"
She wakes up in the hospital.
After everything that happened, Luna and her sister decide to move in with their uncle in Osaka, Japan. Luna knew she couldn’t handle everything on her own.
#[this is a good point to go read Fujji's backstory]
In Japan, Luna decides to use another power of the pact. She asks Probabilitas, "What has the highest probability of happening?" He replies, "There is a 100% chance that it was Anato's body being controlled by Solk. That is what he does—makes a pact, fools the human into trading souls, and then uses that body to freely wield his power."
Luna decides to investigate about the demon, so she can understand Solk's power and why he is doing this.
