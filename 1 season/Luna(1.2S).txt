#This is a continium part of 1.1S
As i got to japan, i have prety much free time, since i quit college and my uncle will sustent us here for long ultil we can get better about all disasters that happen in so short time.
I decide i will use that free time to learn about demon and stuff, so i can undertand all that is happening. There are many material about demons, all contradictory, but i can just ask Probalitas what is real and what is not so i am fine. Also probabilitas is a long name, so i start calling him probas, like i feel we are almost besties, but i dont think he agree. He keeps denying to aswer my question, need to use my power even to conferm what material is real or not.
As all my search shows, demons are creatues who have powers but need a "master" to use their powers... like a genie i guess. Solk is really famos actualy, because he just trade soul of contracting parties and giving demons freewill. The books also mension another creature which is like a demon but can use powers free, but they don't be mencion to much so i don't have enoutgh information. Also i don't see any information about many especific demon, like there is Solk and one called Nagar, but i expect to find at least something about probas, but no luck.
It pasted like 1 week and i am aredy tired of reading, i know i was in literature college, but i wrote more than read. I start to try to get information direcr from probas but he really don't like talking, he get angry when i talk to much. At least i know now he is 60 res old...? i think that is a demon time sistem, but i don't realy get it.
Now i think i am stuck, i don't get any new information, maybe i need to find someone with a pact to tell me things... I don't think so, a aready was in all places of this city, and people with pacts are supose to be able to see demons, so looks like i am the only one walking with a demon o the street. i think i will start looking online, i aredy tryed, got noting but i think books will not work anymore
