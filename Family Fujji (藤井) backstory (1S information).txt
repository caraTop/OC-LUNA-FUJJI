## Fyjji family
The Fujji family plays an important role in this story.
It consists of a brother, two sisters, a mother, and a father.
They all lived together in Osaka at the beginning.
This file lists the important characters in this family and their traits.
(Luna Fujji may also bear this last name but has no blood relation to them.)

## Anato Fujji 
Anato is the middle child of the Fujji family and has always loved writing romance books.
After his older sister died, he was deeply affected, unable to do anything for several months. Eventually, he decided to move to the United States to distance himself from his family.
While in the U.S., he became interested in Satanism and started researching ways to bring his older sister back to life.
After attempting a ritual and failing (due to Luna's interference), he tried again. This time, he summoned Solk, the Soul-Swapper demon, who convinced him to trade his soul in exchange for bringing his sister's soul back.
When Anato agreed, Solk placed a soul entirely loyal to him in Anato's body, allowing Solk to freely use his powers through the body.
Anato has not been seen since then, and only his body, controlled by Solk, remains active throughout 1S.

## Rika Fujji
Rika is the youngest sibling in the Fujji family. She has always been lazy and apathetic toward most things in life.
At the age of 16, she emancipated herself from her family and started living independently, making money by playing online poker and consistently winning.
She attempted suicide three times but always failed. One significant event happened when she was about to jump off a bridge but saw an 8-year-old child falling. Instead of jumping, she saved the childâ€™s life (this saved girl will become important in 1S).
At the age of 19, Rika became involved with the JDM after making a pact with an unnamed demon who can show her five seconds into the future, a skill particularly useful in combat.

## Fujji's older sister
The older sister of the Fujji family is not a central character in 1S, but her death serves as a key motivation for other members of the Fujji family to take significant actions.
