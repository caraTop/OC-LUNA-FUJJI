#(Luna Hagiwara is the same as Luna Fujji, but before she changes her last name)
#(This may be consider a backstory to how she got the pact, go to japan and got her objetive)
Luna Hagiwara is a 19-year-old girl who lives with her mother, father, and little sister in Carson City, Nevada. She is in her first year of literature college and has a boyfriend named Anato Fujji.
Anato Fujji is an 18-year-old from Japan who came to the United States after his sister died. He now lives alone. One day, Anato called Luna to come to his place, but when she got there, he made her faint. She woke up in his basement, literally screwed to the floor (with nails).
Anato then delivered a monologue, explaining that he became a Satanist to try to revive his late sister. He also revealed that he lured Luna because it was the easiest way to kidnap someone as a sacrifice (this part of the story is loosely based on DOMESTIC KANOJO [https://www.crunchyroll.com/pt-br/series/G679D84KY/domestic-girlfriend], but it has changed some parts of it, and it doesn't share the same universe).
Anato started performing the ritual, but he made a mistake. Instead of summoning a demon to make a pact, a demon automatically made a pact with Luna. Afterward, Luna managed to escape and run home without realizing the pact she had unknowingly formed.
