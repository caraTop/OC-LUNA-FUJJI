#(Luna Hagiwara is the same as Luna Fujji, but before she changes her last name)
#(This may be consider a backstory to how she got the pact, go to japan and got her objetive)
Luna Hagiwara is a 19-year-old girl who lives with her mother, father, and little sister in Carson City, Nevada. She is in her first year of literature college and has a boyfriend named Anato Fujji.
Anato Fujji is an 18-year-old from Japan who came to the United States after his sister died. He now lives alone. One day, Anato called Luna to come to his place, but when she got there, he made her faint. She woke up in his basement, literally screwed to the floor (with nails).
Anato then delivered a monologue, explaining that he became a Satanist to try to revive his late sister. He also revealed that he lured Luna because it was the easiest way to kidnap someone as a sacrifice (this part of the story is loosely based on DOMESTIC KANOJO [https://www.crunchyroll.com/pt-br/series/G679D84KY/domestic-girlfriend], but it has changed some parts of it, and it doesn't share the same universe).
Anato started performing the ritual, but he made a mistake. Instead of summoning a demon to make a pact, a demon automatically made a pact with Luna. Afterward, Luna managed to escape and run home without realizing the pact she had unknowingly formed.
When Luna gets home, she rushes to the phone to call the police, but she stops when she sees a tall figure following her. She looks back, startled, and stumbles into her room to hide. With no one else home, the figure finds Luna and begins to speak:
"My name is Probabilitas. I am the demon of probabilities. With this pact signed, you may know the probabilities of something happening or change the probabilities of events. That said, I also have wishes. If this pact brings nothing to me, it will be undone. If you don't use the power within a week, the pact will also be undone. I may appear only to you, to other demons, or to people with pacts."
Still confused, Luna asks the demon what pact he is talking about. He explains that the pact was formed because of the ritual performed by Anato.
Not believing what is happening, Luna decides to test this supposed "power." She looks at an apple on a tree outside the window and says, "Can I make the chance of the apple falling 100%?" As soon as she finishes the sentence, the apple is already falling from the tree, and she looks impressed. Wanting to try something more daring, she quickly says, "Can I change the chance of the apple touching the ground to 0%?" When she looks outside, she is shocked to see the apple floating back to the top of the tree.
