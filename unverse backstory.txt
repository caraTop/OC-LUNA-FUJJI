Long before time had a name, in a world where everything was a black space, gods were disgusted with who would be the main one. Before that, no one knows what existed, but afterward, they decided that all gods would create their own universe, and the one who created the best one would become the main god of this place. There was just one rule: every world in the universe would reset after 30,000 years. This reset worked by bringing the world back to its original form, but if nothing interfered, everything in the world would happen the same way every time.
One of these gods created the universe where this story takes place. After creating many worlds, he thought it would be hard to control all of them, so he decided to create a creature he named "King." Kings were creatures that could escape the reset and were strong enough to take control of the world. A king could transform anyone into a king, unless that person already had a king counterpart (this happened because a king doesn't get reset, but if no one interferes, the human form would be reborn again).
With this, people who desired that kind of power arose, but they never became kings. These people spent their entire lives trying to gain that power, and they found a way to get it without being kings. However, since this power was not granted by the god, it was impure, and they could only use this power on others. The only thing they had for themselves was the ability to survive the reset. These creatures are called demons nowadays (their old name doesn't matter to the story, but it's worth noting that it wasn't always the same like the kings).
These demons began creating something called a pact, where they gave someone the ability to use their power, but with a catch. (Nowadays, they don't give a catch anymore, insted they try to fool the person so they can use the power as they wish.) Kings almost never cared about demons, as they weren't strong enough since they couldn't directly use their power.
------
Once upon a time, there was a couple who both became kings, but not their daughter, who died before that. The man tried many ways to bring his daughter back, but she had been born because of interference in the world they came from, so he could never bring her back. His wife became angry because he was obsessed with this and didn't care about anything else. Then, she did the unthinkable: she made a pact with a demon. By mixing the king's power with the demon's power, she created a metal that could harm kings, which was impossible before since they were immortal. (The wife tried to use the pact to revive her daughter, but she couldn't. Creating the metal to hurt kings wasn't her original intention with the metal.)
After that, she killed her husband and hid to avoid getting caught, as no one knew how killing a king was possible. (She hid with a group of other kings, which could probably make a good spinoff. Among them, she became stronger because of the pact, one used poker cards to manifest her powers, one could enter a mirror dimension of the world, and one could revive those she killed and use them as puppets.)
After some time, kings discovered how the metal was made, and a war started, where kings killed each other, trying to become the last one standing to have the right to do anything possible. (When a king dies, their human form cannot become a king again.) The demons just watched the war from the sidelines as, slowly, all the kings died, leaving only the one who created the metal and her crew, who remained hidden in the mirror dimension until the nowdays. (Canonically, they are all just playing poker, hiding from the demons.)
