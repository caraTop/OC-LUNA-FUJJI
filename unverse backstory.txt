Long before time had a name, in a world where everything was a black space, gods were discusting who whould be the main one, before that no one know what was, but after, they decided, 
all gods would create his own universe, and whose made the best one, would be the main god of this place. There was just one rule, every world in the universe, after 30,000 year resets
that reset works just bringing the world in its original form, but if nothing interfere, everything the world would happen the same, everytime.
One of those gods created the universe this story happens. After creating a ton of world, he thought would be hard to take control of all those, so he decided to create a creature that he named "King"
Kings were creatures that could escape the reset, and be strong enough to take control of the world. A king coukd transforme anyone into a king, unless that one aready have a king contrapart 
(that happen because a king don't get reseted, but if no one interfere in the world, the humen form would reborn again).
With that came people which desire that kind of power, but never got to became a king, those people spend their entire lifes tring to get that power, and they found a way to get it without being a king,
but since this power wasn't give by god, it was impure, and the could use this power just for other, and the only thing they had to themselfs was being able to survive the reset. Those creatures are called demons nowdays
(ther old name doens't matter to the story, but it's good to say that wasn't aways the same like the kings)
Those deamons start creating something called pact, where they gave someone the will to use their power, but with a catch 
(nowdays they don't give a catch anymore, they try to fool the person so they use the power as they want)
Kings almost never cared about deamon, they wans't strong enough since they couldn't derectly use their power.
