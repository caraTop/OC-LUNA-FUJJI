Long before time had a name, in a world where everything was a black space, gods were discusting who whould be the main one, before that no one know what was, but after, they decided, 
all gods would create his own universe, and whose made the best one, would be the main god of this place. There was just one rule, every world in the universe, after 30,000 year resets
that reset works just bringing the world in its original form, but if nothing interfere, everything the world would happen the same, everytime.
One of those gods created the universe this story happens. After creating a ton of world, he thought would be hard to take control of all those, so he decided to create a creature that he named "King"
Kings were creatures that could escape the reset, and be strong enough to take control of the world. A king coukd transforme anyone into a king, unless that one aready have a king contrapart 
(that happen because a king don't get reseted, but if no one interfere in the world, the humen form would reborn again).
With that came people which desire that kind of power, but never got to became a king, those people spend their entire lifes tring to get that power, and they found a way to get it without being a king,
but since this power wasn't give by god, it was impure, and the could use this power just for other, and the only thing they had to themselfs was being able to survive the reset. Those creatures are called demons nowdays
(ther old name doens't matter to the story, but it's good to say that wasn't aways the same like the kings)
Those deamons start creating something called pact, where they gave someone the will to use their power, but with a catch 
(nowdays they don't give a catch anymore, they try to fool the person so they use the power as they want)
Kings almost never cared about deamon, they wans't strong enough since they couldn't derectly use their power.
------
Once a time, there was a couple, which both became a king, but not their daughter, that died before that, the man tried may ways to get his daughter back, but she was born because of interfere on the world they came from, so he never could bring her back. His wife was mad because he was obsessed about that and didn't care about anythng else, and then she did the unthinkable, a pack with a demon, and mixng kings power with demons power, she made a metal, which could hurt kings, what was impossible before since they were imortal,
(the wife tried to use the pack to revive her daughter, but couldn't, and when creating the metal, hurting kings wasn't what she wanted the metal for)
After that, she kill her husband, and hide to not get caught, since nobody knew how killing a king was possible. 
[She hides with a group with other kings which #probally can be a good spinoff, where there is this one, which is stronger because of the pact, one that use poker card to manifest her powers, one that can go to a mirror dimention of the world, and one that can revive who she kills and use as puppets]
After some time, kings discover how that metal was made, and a war starts, where kings kills themselfs, trying to became the only one left, to have ritgh to do anything possible,
(when a king die, they human form can not became a king again)
the demons just whach the war in the back, as slowly all kings die, only remaining, that one who created the metal and her crew, who are hidden on the mirror dimention until the end of the days
(canonically they are all just playing poker, hiding from the deamons)
